# Project 2: Quiz Challenge

# A brief description of the application
- The "Drill and practice" is the second project during the course Web Software Development organized by Aalto University. 
- The application provides a list of topics and allows creating multiple-choice questions into those topics that are then answered by self and others. 
- The application also shows basic statistics: the total number of available questions and the total number of question answers. 
- In addition, the application provides an API for retrieving and answering random questions. 
- The application must use a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers (views, controllers, services, database). Furthermore, the application naturally needs to be built using Deno and Oak.
- The application is built based on the structural knowledge of web development together with the support of other techniques and tools including Docker, Heroku, PostgreSQL and or ElephanSQL. 
- The software should be able to meet the requirement of course about steps and successfully worked in both locally as well as Heroku host deployment.

# The location where the application has been deployed and where one can test it
- The application is shared for the purpose of test and review freely: https://quiz-challenge-thy-khuu.herokuapp.com/

# Guidelines for running the application locally
- Run the Docker.
- Run VSCode, open the container folder where all project files inside. 
- Open the terminal where the root directory contains the file "docker-compose.yml"
- From CMD, enter the command "docker-compose up" to start Docker and create locally host.  
- On the web browser, enter https:/localhost:7777 to run and test the application locally.
